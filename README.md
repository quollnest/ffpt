# Pauli-Tracker FF

This is an attempt at an tuned version of pauli-tracker by
@taeruh - `https://github.com/taeruh/pauli_tracker`.

I recommend that everyone checks out his work before this
as this has been designed with another project in mind
and reduces the real-time cost in `pauli_track` method.

This is currently experimental and correctness is not guaranteed at all.
